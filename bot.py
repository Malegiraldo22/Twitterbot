            1.  **Engagement and Structure:** Is the tweet well-structured, interesting, and likely to engage a real audience? Does it sound like a tweet a real person would post? Does it use natural and conversational language, not overly formal or robotic?
            2.  **Authenticity:** Does the tweet sound authentic and human-like, or does it sound generated? Does the voice seem consistent with the assigned persona?

            4.  **No Placeholders:** Does the tweet contain any placeholders such as [], [enterprise], [company], etc.?
